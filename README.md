# FrontDesk AI

**v1.0.5 · Self-hosted AI receptionist for clinics, salons and service businesses**

FrontDesk AI combines a modern responsive landing page, visitor chat, 60-minute appointments, and an authenticated business dashboard. Admin, bookings, conversations, FAQs, settings, secure one-click isolated demo, and tests are included.

- **Landing:** `/`
- **Visitor chat:** `/chat`
- **Admin workspace:** `/admin/login` → `/admin`
- **Health:** `/health` reports version `1.0.5` and avoids exposing secrets.

## Root-first GitHub → Render deployment

**Deploy the full unpacked package from its root using Docker.** The codebase remains only in `FrontDesk Project/` per the packaged structure; root orchestration files are configuration, not a second application copy. Read **[GITHUB-RENDER.md](GITHUB-RENDER.md)** for detailed GitHub upload and Render settings.

| Required Render setting | Exact value |
|---|---|
| Runtime / Language | **Docker** |
| Root Directory | **blank** (use repository root) |
| Dockerfile Path | **./Dockerfile** |
| Docker Build Context | **.** (repository root) |
| Docker Command | **blank**, use root Dockerfile CMD |
| Build Command | blank / not used for Docker |
| Start Command override | blank / not used for Docker |
| Health Check Path | **/health** |
| Instance count | **1** while using SQLite / process-local demo capacity |

The root `render.yaml` is the one canonical Blueprint. Its `rootDir: .` explicitly matches repository root; Docker builds extract the correct source and entrypoint below. No stale nested Blueprint is shipped.

### Why the original root-docker failure is fixed

The root Dockerfile explicitly resolves nested requirements then flattens **only** the source directory:

```dockerfile
COPY ["FrontDesk Project/requirements.lock", "/app/requirements.lock"]
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --require-hashes -r /app/requirements.lock
COPY ["FrontDesk Project/", "/app/"]
```

The trailing slash on the source copies the directory **contents**; JSON quoting preserves the space in `FrontDesk Project`. `/app/main.py`, `/app/app`, `/app/routes`, `/app/templates`, `/app/static` and `/app/requirements.lock` result; `/app/FrontDesk Project/main.py` is not needed. CMD starts `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-10000}` in the Linux image shell, following Render's default optional `PORT` behavior. There is no root `main.py` and no root `requirements.lock` copy to maintain.

Upload the **contents** of the extracted ZIP into the GitHub repository root—not the ZIP itself or another enclosing `FrontDesk_AI-*` directory. Do not independently copy nested Dockerfile or lockfile to GitHub root. If your repository has manually duplicated root lockfile or stale root Docker files from a workaround, replace/remove those conflicting tracked deployment files as part of your own repository update. Do not delete user data or production databases; review and secure any sensitive files in repository history.

For manual Render Docker services, configure these fields yourself. Alternatively use the root `render.yaml` Blueprint; omit native build/start commands. `/app/requirements.lock` comes from `FrontDesk Project/requirements.lock`; no container-wide root `COPY . .` is used. Image includes application runtime only, not docs or root `.env`.

### Two Docker contexts, not two application versions

1. **Primary (Compose / Render / GitHub):** run `docker build -f Dockerfile .` in the complete root. Root `.dockerignore` filters the build context and the nested contents are copied into a flat `/app` inside the image.
2. **Optional standalone project build:** `docker build -f "FrontDesk Project/Dockerfile" "FrontDesk Project"` from the root. This applies nested `.dockerignore` and intentionally reads the lockfile in the nested context before `COPY . /app/`. This Dockerfile is optional and does not replace root deployment.

Successful `main:app` import in a simulated flattened `/app` runtime uses both source app routes and absolute static/template references underneath it. Root tests materialize both build layouts, ignore files and the real Uvicorn process—but **actual image build/startup requires Docker/BuildKit** and is unverified if an engine isn't available locally.

No `main.py`, `requirements.lock`, `app/`, `templates/` or `static/` is duplicated at repository root. No real `.env`, SQLite DB, demo sandbox, `.git`, venv or cache belongs in the ZIP.

## Environment configuration

Two byte-identical placeholder `.env.example` files are intentional. Neither contains usable secrets and neither substitutes for a real private environment variable configuration. **Keep both examples synchronized whenever editing a placeholder variable.** Compare `cmp .env.example "FrontDesk Project/.env.example"` at archive root (Linux/macOS) or the two `(Get-FileHash ...).Hash` results (PowerShell). Root `.gitignore` and context-specific `.dockerignore` exclude actual `.env` files, key material, DB/journal files, sandboxes, interpreters and caches.

| Workflow | Working directory | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Local Linux/macOS/Windows/VPS | `FrontDesk Project/` | Same-directory `.env` created manually from adjacent `.env.example` |
| Docker Compose at archive root | Root with `docker-compose.yml` | **Root `.env`** from root `.env.example` |
| GitHub → Render Docker | Full extracted root → repository root | Render Environment settings; no committed/private `.env` |
| Standalone nested Docker build | Entire `FrontDesk Project` context | Explicit container environment values; example only for reference |

`app/config.py` specifies relative `env_file=".env"` resolved against runtime **working** directory; app folders are not searched upward for archive-root `.env`. Local/VPS starts from nested source folder. Compose explicit `env_file: .env` and root variable interpolation are not the local app dotenv search and still get root secrets. Docker root build copies nested app contents only, so no private root env ends up in static code, templating or static media.

### Local Linux / macOS

After extracting the archive, from its root:

```bash
cd "FrontDesk Project"
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
cp .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"  # paste as SECRET_KEY
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))"  # paste as SETUP_TOKEN
mkdir -p data
python -m app.init_db
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

Edit `.env` **before initialization** to substitute private `SECRET_KEY`, and `SETUP_TOKEN` for browser setup (or private `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` alternative). Visitor URLs: localhost:10000/, /admin/login, /chat. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is hashed when first successful login bootstraps it. Keep `HTTPS_ONLY=true` behind HTTPS proxy. Set local `HTTPS_ONLY=false` otherwise.

### Windows PowerShell (`py` + venv)

From archive root (after `Set-Location` to extracted root):

```powershell
Set-Location ".\FrontDesk Project"
py -3.12 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 12)"
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
Copy-Item .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"  # paste as SECRET_KEY
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))"  # paste as SETUP_TOKEN
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force data | Out-Null
python -m app.init_db
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
```

`py -3.12` creates the required Python 3.12 venv; subsequent installed and runtime commands intentionally use activated venv's `python`, avoiding dependency writes to the system interpreter. Edit `.env` before init. Don't substitute `source` or Command Prompt's activate command into PowerShell.

### Docker Compose

At the extracted root, create root `.env` using the root example and replace the mandatory `SECRET_KEY`. Supply `SETUP_TOKEN` or private `ADMIN_*` to initialize a private installation.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

PowerShell: `py -3.12 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))'`; then `Copy-Item .env.example .env`; edit it privately and run same docker compose command. By default listen at `http://localhost:10000`, mapping host `${PORT:-10000}` to internal 10000. If host `PORT` is set to 8080 browse to 8080. Root runtime data maps `/app/data` to nested `FrontDesk Project/data`; one nested copy in the package. There is no need to create project `.env` simultaneously with this Compose setup. Actual Compose uses root `context: .`, `dockerfile: Dockerfile`.

### Render secrets and demo-opt-in guidance

**Default production** is `DEMO_MODE=false`, `HTTPS_ONLY=true`. Root `render.yaml` defines `SECRET_KEY` with `generateValue: true`. The **published Render Blueprint specification supports generating a random base64-encoded 256-bit value** when the variable is not already set. Render preserves existing secret values on subsequent Blueprint syncs. No guarantee of secret rotation after configuration unless managed by operator.

Optional Blueprint secret `sync: false` entries prompt for input during **initial creation only**. On updates, newly added or changed `sync:false` values are ignored; enter them via Render Environment manually. A **manual Docker service** can't assume automatic Blueprint secret generation; generate and enter your own fresh private `SECRET_KEY` using Render's credentials controls. Required production choices remain private `SETUP_TOKEN` or a private `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` bootstrap.

**Dedicated one-click public review** must be a **separate clean Render service** with: `DEMO_MODE=true`, `DEMO_SEED=review-v1`, `DEMO_MAX_SESSIONS=200`, `HTTPS_ONLY=true`, a fresh secret generated by Render or manually, and **no real credentials / production DB**. Leave `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `SETUP_TOKEN`, `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_MODEL` unset for that demo. `DATABASE_URL` is not needed for dedicated demo storage. Though that field is discarded before demo engine creation, still do not use any real production DSN in a demo deployment.

Production *must* remain `DEMO_MODE=false` and use persistent storage, such as a disk mounted `/app/data` or owner-managed persistent DB appropriate for the app. No disk, database or deployment is provisioned by this archive. Free ephemeral SQLite sample/sandboxes reset as expected. Demo has per-signed cookie scoped storage under `data/demo-<seed>/`, local deterministic FAQ/booking, no external AI network, and server-required CSRF/role/ownership restrictions. An admin demo may update fictional appointment status and manage only its own new FAQs/chat. It cannot delete or alter seed/other reviewer records or sensitive settings. Default cap 200 scopes is per-worker, not distributed; sandboxes not auto-purged. Operator chooses external reset/cleanup for long-lived public demo.

## Included behavior preserved from v1.0.4

- Actual SQL-backed KPI dashboard: today/upcoming schedules, conversations, messages, FAQs, seven-day conversation activity, calculated booking conversion.
- Search/filter appointments; confirmed/completed/cancelled statuses only.
- Conversation listing/detail and CSRF-protected ownership guard.
- FAQ add/edit/enable/disable/filter/delete; safe hours/holidays provider settings and password length.
- Signed sessions, sole real role `admin`, role checks at router and mutation level; CSRF, login/session rate limiting, secure initial bootstrap honoring placeholders only in tests.
- bcrypt password hashes, Fernet encryption for configured API key and invalid-key error controls; no plaintext fallback or credentials in UI source.
- Modern navigation/dashboard/landing and actual old visitor example with current v1.0.4 admin dashboard capture captioned as fictional data. Historical v1.0.3 docs screenshots explicitly remain historical.
- All assets are local, including local Tailwind vendor license. Environment provider can be any OpenAI-compatible URL/auth stored in admin settings (no provider network in demo paths).

## Run tests and dependency audit

From archive root with a local virtualenv and requirements-dev installed:

```bash
python -m pip install -r "FrontDesk Project/requirements-dev.txt"
python -m pytest -q
python -m pip-audit -r "FrontDesk Project/requirements.lock"
```

`pytest -q "FrontDesk Project/tests"` selects original application suite only. Root `tests/` includes root build/ignore/file layout/Blueprint/Compose/flattened-app startup regression checks. Root Dockerfile always consumes nested lock. Install root-test YAML support with `python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt` if `python -m pytest` reports missing PyYAML. The original application dev requirements only add pytest/pip-audit and already have the app's transitive YAML via `pip-audit`; root tests do not change runtime dependencies.

An optional `tests/docker_matcher` source helper calls upstream Moby pattern matching to verify real Docker ignore semantics. It builds offline if Go is installed with bundled licensed source, skipping that assertion otherwise; the application never needs Go. Real `.gitignore` behavior is tested only against synthetic files in a newly initialized temporary repo. Exact Docker Linux CMD is launched on temporary local HTTP endpoints with a generated secret (not test-bypass) on default port 10000 if free plus an alternate port. Temporary DBs go under pytest temp storage, never the packaged data directory.

No Docker Engine image build/container startup or Render deployment was available/run locally. Flattened tests and isolated YAML schema validation do not substitute for those checks. `docker build -f Dockerfile .` from the archive root in your own Docker environment before publishing. No Vibe96 or any Marketplace audit approval is promised.

HowToSetup describes local/Windows/Docker/VPS detailed commands and update from 1.0.4. Only external runtime AI provider chat makes network requests when manually configured production settings. No deployment submission automatically runs with packaged test.
